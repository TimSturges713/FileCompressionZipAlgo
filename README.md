# TimFileZipper (V1)
A personal implementation of file compression algorithms (LZ77, Huffmann) using original handwritten code. Practicing understanding algorithms and their concepts, and putting that knowledge into a coding implementation.

Uses a .tim file for no specific reason, just thought it was funny to have my own format.

Can decompress and compress .txt and .tim files.

LZ77 algorithm complete, uses a command line interface. Just follow the guidelines it lays out for you.
